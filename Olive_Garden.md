as a wise man once said
> I like food because

> Food is good

one day when i was eating food i decided to go to olive garden. That was the day my life changed

I have never been the same since eating olive garden. every day i crave breadsticks and an eggplant parmigiana. 

This must mean i am addicted. but i can stop when i want. i do not want to stop though.

i could go for some olive garden right now.

bye.
